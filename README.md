# flutter_webview

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
Flutter Blob Data Download in WebView Example
This repository contains an example of how to download blob data in a Flutter WebView. The example demonstrates how to handle blob data (binary large objects) in a WebView and enable users to download files directly from the WebView.

Description
The Flutter framework allows developers to build hybrid mobile applications using Dart programming language. However, handling blob data in a WebView can be a challenging task, especially when it comes to enabling file downloads. This example provides a solution to this problem by showcasing a step-by-step implementation of downloading blob data in a WebView.

Features
Load and display a WebView with blob data content.
Implement a custom JavaScript bridge to communicate between WebView and Flutter.
Enable users to download files from the WebView with blob data.
Requirements
To run this example, you need the following:

Flutter SDK installed on your development environment.
A code editor (such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio).
A compatible web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.).
A mobile device or emulator to test the Flutter application.
How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-blob-download-example.git
Save to grepper
Open the cloned project in your preferred code editor.

Ensure you have set up the Flutter SDK and have a compatible web browser installed.

Run the application on your emulator or connected device using the following command:

bash
Copy code
flutter run
Save to grepper
The application will launch, displaying a WebView containing blob data.

To test the blob data download functionality, click on the download link provided in the WebView.

Implementation Details
The implementation of blob data download in the WebView involves the following steps:

Loading the blob data into the WebView using custom HTML and JavaScript.
Creating a JavaScript bridge to communicate between WebView and Flutter.
Triggering file downloads from the WebView using JavaScript methods.
Dependencies
The example uses the following Flutter packages:

webview_flutter: To display the WebView in the Flutter application.
url_launcher: To handle the file downloads triggered from the WebView.
